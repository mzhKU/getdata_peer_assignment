# Description of run_analysis.R

## Overview
This script merges the training and test sets obtained
from a motion sensor in a mobile phone (called 'xytot').
Then, the data corresponding to mean and standard
deviations are extracted from that merged data set
('means_stds').

## How to execute the script
The script is called by executing
$ ./run_analysis.R
on the command line.

## Requirements
In the directory of the script, a directory
called 'UCI HAR Dataset' needs to be present and
containing the data from the assignment in its
original form.
