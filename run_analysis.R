# -----------
# Load data sets:
# The script requires the directory structures
# './uci/test' and './uci/train' to be in the same
# directory as this script.
# X_test: 2974 rows by 561 columns, each row identifies
#         the subject who performed the activity (i.e. a
#         feature vector).
# y_test: 2974 rows by 1 column, each value represents
#         the value obtained by the mapping of f(X) -> y.
# The training sets are analoguous.
#
# Loading test and training data sets. Data are in 'UCI HAR Dataset/test'
# and 'uci/training' directories.
